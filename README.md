# Character Pixels Experiment

This project is an experiment in procedural generation for storytelling and generative art. It generates unique pixel-art characters with names and backstories.

## How It Works

### 1. Character Generation (`js/core/generator.js`)
The visual generation process follows these steps:
-   **Skeleton Construction**: A "skeleton" is built using trapezoids for body parts (torso, limbs, head).
-   **Heatmap Generation**: A probability heatmap is created based on the skeleton shapes.
-   **Pixel Filling**: Pixels are filled based on the heatmap density and a random palette.
-   **Mirroring**: The left side is mirrored to the right to create symmetry (humanoid effect).
-   **Post-Processing**: Cellular automata smoothing and outlining are applied to clean up the sprite.

### 2. Name Generation (`js/utils/name-generator.js`)
Names are generated by combining random prefixes and suffixes from predefined lists. There is also a chance to append a title (e.g., "the Brave").

### 3. Backstory Generation (`js/backstory-generator.js`)
Backstories are generated using a template system:
-   **Data Pools**: Lists of places, origins, skills, and reputation claims are stored in `js/backstory-dataset.js`.
-   **Patterns**: Different narrative patterns (A-F) combine these elements in various ways (e.g., Origin + Skill + Reputation).
-   **Resolution**: Placeholders in templates (like `{a|b}`) are recursively resolved to random options.

## Project Structure

-   `index.html`: Main entry point.
-   `js/main.js`: Orchestrates the application, UI logic, and generation flow.
-   `js/core/`: Contains the core generation logic (`generator.js`) and rendering (`renderer.js`).
-   `js/utils/`: Utility functions for math, randomness, and name generation.
-   `js/backstory-generator.js`: Logic for generating text descriptions.
-   `js/backstory-dataset.js`: Data pools for the backstory generator.

## Usage

1.  Open `index.html` in a browser.
2.  Use the sliders to adjust generation parameters (limb sizes, angles, etc.).
3.  Click "Generate" to create new characters.
4.  Click on a character card to view their generated backstory.
5.  Use "Export" buttons to save spritesheets or ZIP archives.
